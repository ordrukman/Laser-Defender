# Laser-Defender
A Top-Down Space Shooter with enemies to shoot and dodge.

This project from Udemy course I took is called Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D. I took this course to learn Unity in C# & Code, 2D Video Games for Web, Mac & PC.
A game written in C# using UI in Unity.

Gameplay:

The player has to survive as long as possible while killing as many hostile spaceships as possible which gives him points. He must collect as many points as possible while dealing with different enemies that come in different waves. The game has several features visual and auditory effects. When the player runs out of life he dies and moves on to the GAME OVER screen where the number of points he has collected is displayed and the option for another game or return to the main menu.
The project is based on the course I took at Unity and implemented design templates of the code like Singleton.
